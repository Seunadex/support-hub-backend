## ðŸš€ Local Setup

1. **Clone repo**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Seunadex/support-hub-backend.git
   cd support-hub-backend
   ```
2. **Set environment variables**

   Copy the example environment file and update values as needed:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   `.env.example` includes `DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY`. You need to generate a secret using `bin/rails secret` and set it either in `.env` or in Rails credentials.

   Edit `.env` to set your environment variables.

3. **Run setup script**

   ```bash
   bin/setup
   ```

   ```bash
   bin/dev
   ```

### ðŸ”‘ JWT Secret Setup

The app uses Devise JWT. You must provide a secret key:

1. Generate one: `bin/rails secret`
2. Add to `.env`:
   DEVISE_JWT_SECRET_KEY=<secret>
   Or add to `config/credentials/development.yml.enc`:
   devise_jwt_secret_key: <secret>

## ðŸ§ª Running Tests

Run the full test suite using RSpec:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
